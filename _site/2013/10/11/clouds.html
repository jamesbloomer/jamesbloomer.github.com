        </header>
        <p>For most of my early life clouds were a far away feature, a distant part of the sky. I grew up in the middle of England with no mountains around me and hills only maybe a hundred metres tall. I&#39;d look up and there would be clouds but I had no concept of how high they were or what they consisted of. They just were. Sometimes there would be fog or mist, but that was something different, a different feature of the weather.</p>

<p>The height of clouds was one of the first things that struck me when I moved to Geneva. Driving out from the city towards CERN the Jura lie ahead, not massive mountains for the region but bigger than anything I&#39;d ever been used to. It was immediately obvious if the clouds were a certain height, they&#39;d cut off the tops of the hills. That was a revelation to me. Suddenly clouds were not a remote part of the world above me but right there, interacting with my physical world.</p>

<p>Of course after a while this becomes normality and sight of the cloud shrouded Jura was something I barely acknowledged. It doesn&#39;t seem to take too long to become accustomed to something, to adjust to a new normality. Then, when I moved back to England, eventually the sight of clouds covering hills faded to a distant memory...</p>

<p>Until the other week when the tops of the cooling towers of the power station I drive past every day were cloaked in low cloud. It made me think of the Jura, made me think of the clouds, made me think of the times when I&#39;ve been up mountains with clouds below me. It sparked a little moment of wonder within me, a moment when I really appreciated the world around me and I actually looked at the clouds rather than take them for granted.</p>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t it be nice if we could turn on those moments of wonder more frequently and look at the world around us afresh? Perhaps I need to be a little more observant and those moments might come more frequently.</p>
