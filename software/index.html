        <p>James Bloomer is a software engineer with many years experience of architecture, design, development and leading teams, having worked on a wide range of products in a variety of industries. His first computer was a ZX81 (with a 16K RAM pack), followed by a Acorn BBC 32k and still has fond memories of BBC BASIC. Whilst working at CERN he ran analytics jobs on SGI machines, whilst using the old mainframe as probably the most expensive chat system on the planet.
