        <p>James Bloomer has many years experience as a professional software developer. Amongst other things he has worked on: call centre and CRM software for banks, a CMS for a world rally team, automated cash collection software that made a company four million pounds in one week, and software to manage and analyse thousands of mobile devices. His first computer was a ZX81 (with a 16K RAM pack), followed by a Acorn BBC 32k and still has fond memories of BBC BASIC. Whilst working at CERN he ran analytics jobs on SGI machines, alledgedly because of their network capacity, whilst using the old mainframe as probably the most expensive chat system on the planet. Having traversed the well worn path from BASIC to FORTRAN to C++ to C# he was seduced a couple of years ago by Javascript in the form of node.js. You can find him on Github at <a href="http://www.github.com/jamesbloomer">@jamesbloomer</a>.</p>
