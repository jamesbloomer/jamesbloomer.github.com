title: The Foreign Lands of Country Music
---

Where I live, in the UK, country music, as in American country music from the USA, is not that big a thing. There's people who like it, yes, but it's a niche music genre, it's not part of the culture. So you may think it a bit strange that someone who grew up in The Black Country listening to a strict diet of heavy metal and shredding guitar music actually likes modern country music. It's not so strange, let me explain.

Firstly it's so foreign. Yes I can understand the language (American is vaguely the same English), but the things that the songs talk about are strange and otherwordly: trucks, driving past where the road ends, parties in the middle of nowhere, swimming in lakes (without wetsuits!), tailgates, chevys, kegs and lots of beer without a pub in sight.

As a quick tangent, it always seems odd to me that country music comes from (more or less) a region of the USA which is pretty religious and yet there is endless talk of drinking beer and getting wasted. Maybe it's a rellious thing?

Anyway, that foreign-ness is very appealing, it takes me away from day to day life to a strange new land. Sometimes it's funny, sometimes it's baffling, sometimes it's unbelievable, but it's always something different.

Another appealing aspect is the combination of nostalgia and appreciating the present....
